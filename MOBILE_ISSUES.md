# Mobile UX Issues - Day 8 Testing

## Critical (Blocking MVP)
1. **Slider doesn't work** - Can't drag, only tap. Core interaction broken.
2. **No selection feedback** - Can't see what's selected. Users will think it's broken.
3. **Extremely cramped** - Everything touching, no visual hierarchy.
4. **Charts cut off** - Major feature unusable on mobile.

## High Priority
- Text too small
- Buttons too close together  
- No padding anywhere
- Form feels overwhelming
- Save button hard to find

## The Reality
Current state: Functional prototype
Needed for MVP: Clean, focused, delightful
Gap: Complete UX redesign needed
