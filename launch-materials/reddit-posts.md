## r/ChronicIllness Version

**Title**: After tracking symptoms for 2 weeks, I discovered my triggers have a 12-24 hour delay

**Post**:
I've been dealing with chronic symptoms for years. Every doctor visit went the same way:
"What triggers your symptoms?" - "I don't know, seems random"
"When do they occur?" - "No pattern I can see"

Built a simple web app that tracks symptoms with timestamps and duration. After 14 days, it found patterns I never noticed: my worst symptoms hit 12-24 hours after certain foods, not immediately.

The app found a 65% confidence correlation between dairy and my symptoms with that specific delay. Showed this to my doctor - she said delayed reactions are actually common but hard to spot without consistent tracking.

The app is free, no signup required, works offline: [YOUR-VERCEL-URL]

Just sharing what helped me. Your patterns will be different, but the time delay discovery was eye-opening.

## r/ibs Version

**Title**: My IBS wasn't random - it was dairy with a 14-hour delay

**Post**:
For years I thought my IBS was completely unpredictable. I'd eat dairy, feel fine, then randomly have issues "for no reason" the next day.

Started using a symptom tracker I built that specifically looks for time-delayed patterns. After 2 weeks: clear pattern emerged - symptoms hit 12-18 hours after dairy, not immediately.

This explains why I never made the connection. When you have symptoms at lunch, you don't think about what you ate for dinner yesterday.

Free web app if anyone wants to try: [YOUR-VERCEL-URL]
No ads, no signup, works offline. Just tracks patterns.

## r/migraine Version  

**Title**: Found my migraine trigger: 36-hour delay after red wine

**Post**:
Always suspected wine triggered my migraines but could never prove it. I'd drink wine Friday night, feel fine Saturday, then get hit Sunday afternoon.

Built a pattern detection app that analyzes symptoms with various time delays. Found it: 85% of my migraines occur 30-42 hours after red wine.

Doctor confirmed this is a known pattern for some people - the delayed histamine/tyramine response.

Takes about 14 days of tracking to find patterns.
